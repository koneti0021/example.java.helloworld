How did the idea for doodles originate?
In 1998, before the company was even incorporated, the concept of the doodle
was born when Google founders Larry and Sergey played with the corporate 
logo to indicate their attendance at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. 
They placed a stick figure drawing behind the 2nd "o" in the word, Google, and the revised logo was 
intended as a comical message to Google users that the founders were "out of office.".
While the first doodle was relatively simple, 
the idea of decorating the company logo to celebrate notable events was born.
